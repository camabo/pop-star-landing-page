        <h2>About First Aid Kit</h2>
        <p>A Swedish indie folk duo with a devoted international following, First Aid Kit blend the bright vocal
            harmonies and
            pastoral, contemplative songwriting of sisters Klara and Johanna Söderberg. After receiving radio
            play
            in
            Sweden as
            teenagers, they went on to chart across Europe, and in the U.S. and Australia with albums such as
            The
            Lion's
            Roar
            (2012), Stay Gold (2014), and the breakup-inspired Ruins (2018). Modeled on the '80s production of
            acts
            like
            Fleetwood
            Mac and Tom Petty, their more uplifting fifth studio LP, Palomino, was released in 2022.</p>
        <p>Starting, as many sibling acts have done, simply singing together as kids, Swedish sisters Johanna
            and
            Klara
            Söderberg
            came to realize their voices worked together in a way that was more than just a fun pastime. Others
            heard
            it, too, and
            by the time they were in their mid-teens they were working under the band name First Aid Kit and
            getting
            their music on
            Swedish radio. Soon they had a recording contract and were embarking on their first tour.

            It wasn’t long before they were working with their heroes Bright Eyes and playing high-profile
            events
            like
            the Polar
            Music Prize banquet, where their music brought Emmylou Harris to tears.

            This month, the Söderberg singers have released their fifth album, Palomino, and announced an
            international
            tour, one
            that will bring them to Denver in May of 2023.</p>
